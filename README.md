## Contracts

### Versions

#### V1

- Experimented with the idea of using post fragments to create a doubly linked list that comprised posts. All fragments were individually signed by their creator to prove authenticity. 3rd parties could publish posts to the contract to earn fixed amount of tokens which then could subsequently be reused for the same purpose.
- Brought up the idea of embedded tipping but ultimately dropped as a security concern and issue of complexity. Tipping still thought to be an important feature, but likely a feature that should be apart of the scheme of a post rather than interpreted internally from the post.
- Huffman explored to allow for international support and compression (wider variety of symbols than ASCII and more compressed than UTF8).
